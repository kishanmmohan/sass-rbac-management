# Functional Requirements for the RBAC System

This document outlines the essential functions that the RBAC system must support to manage user access, groups, roles,
and organizational boundaries effectively.

---

## 1. User and User Type

- **User Account Creation and Management:**  
  The system shall allow administrators to create, update, and delete user accounts.

- **User Type Assignment:**  
  Each user is classified by a user type, which determines their scope of access:
    - **Super Admin:**
        - A single, system-wide authority with full control across all organizations.
    - **Admin:**
        - Internal users responsible for overarching system management and operations.
    - **Staff:**
        - Internal users who handle internal support and operational tasks.
    - **Owner:**
        - The designated owner of an organization, holding complete control over that organizationâ€™s settings and
          permissions.
    - **Org-Staff:**
        - Organization-specific staff members who perform day-to-day operational tasks within their assigned
          organization. Their access is confined to their organization, and permissions are granted via roles and
          groups.

- **Organization Association:**  
  Users must be associated with one or more organizations. Global roles like Super Admin have access across all
  organizations, while others (such as Staff, Org-Staff, and Owner) are limited to the organizations to which they are
  assigned.

## 2. Group

- **Group Creation and Configuration:**  
  Groups shall be created within each organization to enable the collective management of user permissions.

- **User Group Assignment:**  
  Administrators can add or remove users from groups, ensuring that group memberships are organization-specific.

- **Group-Based Permission Management:**  
  Groups serve as a means to apply predefined permission sets (via roles) to multiple users at once within an
  organization.

## 3. Role

- **Role Definition:**  
  Roles are defined as a set of permissions tailored for each organization. They specify what actions users or groups
  can perform within the system.

- **Assignment of Roles:**  
  Roles can be assigned via two primary paths:
    - **Direct Role Assignment to Users (Permission > Role > User):**  
      Roles containing bundled permissions may be assigned directly to individual users.
    - **Role Assignment to Groups (Permission > Role > Group > User):**  
      Roles may be assigned to groups, with users inheriting the permissions through their group membership.

- **Organizational Ties:**  
  Both roles and groups exist strictly within the boundaries of each organization, ensuring that permissions are
  contextually relevant and isolated.

## 4. Organization

- **Multi-Organization Support:**  
  The system shall support multiple organizations (tenants) and allow users to be associated with more than one
  organization.

- **Access Restrictions:**  
  Users are granted access only to the organizations they are assigned to, with global roles like Super Admin and Admin
  having broader access.

---

## 5. Module and Module Permissions

- **Module Definition:**  
  The system is divided into modules representing different features or functional areas.

- **CRUD Permission Levels:**  
  Each module has defined permissions for:
    - **Read**
    - **Create**
    - **Update**
    - **Delete**

- **Permission Assignment Paths:**  
  The system supports three distinct methods for granting permissions:
    1. **Permission > User:**  
       Permissions can be directly assigned to individual users.
    2. **Permission > Role > User:**  
       Permissions are bundled into roles, which can then be directly assigned to users.
    3. **Permission > Role > Group > User:**  
       Permissions are bundled into roles that can be assigned to groups, and users inherit these permissions through
       their group membership.

## 6. Auditing and Administration

- **Change Tracking:**  
  All modifications to user accounts, group memberships, role assignments, and permission settings must be tracked and
  auditable to ensure accountability.

- **Administrative Oversight:**  
  Super Admins, Admins, Owners, and Org-Staff (through their assigned roles and groups) shall have tools to review and
  modify permission settings, maintaining a consistent and secure access control framework.
